### Introduction

On, January 1st, 2012 the California Fish and Game Network established Marine Protected Areas (MPA) {include something about legislation and designation levels} in the waters off Isla Vista and Naples, California. This came as an effort to better understand factors such as abundance, size, and fishing pressure on the California spiny lobster as well as natural kelp forest community dynamics and the affects MPA’s have on them{CITATION OF ABSTRACT}. Previous studies suggested that small isolated marine protected areas are effective at increasing abundance and size of *P.interruptus* {CITATION}. Using data collected from five sites along the Santa Barbara coastline, including the two Marine Protected Areas mentioned above, by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTR), we explore lobster population and size changes over six years in an attempt to show MPA effectiveness .{NEED CITATION ABSTRACT}.

### Data and Methods

Data for *P. interruptus* size and abondance was collected between 2012 and 2018. This data was collected by the 
Data for Swedish Griffin abundance and location from 1984 - 2019 were collected and provided by the Fantastic Beasts Research Team. Griffin abundance (individuals) is estimated from annual aerial counts. Griffin location (latitude, longitude) is uploaded daily from GPS-enabled collars, and used to estimate range areas (km2). For more information on collection methods and spatial information, see metadata. Habitat shifts were based on aerial observation and GPS locations, and were binned for this report as “Grassland”, “Forest” or “Exposed rock”. Mean griffin range area (km2) was compared for pre-dragon (1984 - 2004) and post-dragon (2005 - 2019) periods by two-sample t-tests (α = 0.05 throughout). Trends in Griffin abundance were compared before and after dragon reintroduction by linear regression. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1{DATA AND METHODS INCLUDE TIME SERIES PLOT FOR LOBSTER ABUNDANCE, A VIOLIN PLOT TO SEE DISTRIBUTION OF SIZES OVER TIME, AND TWO SIDED WELCH T-TEST}

Change in counts between 2012 and 2018 shows greatest population increases in the Marine Protected Areas.  IV and Naples increased by `r diff_IVEE["2018","2012"]` and `r diff_NAPL["2018","2012"]` lobsters respectively while Arroyo, Carp, and Mohawk increased by `r diff_AQUE["2018","2012"]`, `r diff_CARP["2018","2012"]`, `r diff_MOHK["2018","2012"]`. However, comparing population changes between different years provides very different outcomes. For example, the differences the  More years of study would be required to understand the long term effects of abundance in MPAs. Trending the year to year changes, the Marine Protected Areas had population increases every year except 2015 for IV and Naples and 2016 for Naples (9 of 12 increased 75%).  In comparison, the non Marine Protected Areas increased 8 of their combined 18 years(44%). An interesting aspect is the comparison of Isla Vista and Carpinteria between 2017 and 2018. Fishing pressure is potentially an explaination of the drop in population in Carpinteria compared to Isla Vista.

#### Results B: Visually explore lobster size distribution shifts by comparing lobster sizes in 2012 and 2018

Comparing lobster sizes at catch sites for 2012 and 2018 shows Marine Protected Area lobsters increasing in size. The peak distribution in size at MPA sites shifted closer to the minimum catch size over this period. Non-protected area lobsters on the other hand, remained relatively unchanged in the distributuion of sizes. This increase in density for larger lobsters in the Marine Protected Area suggests more lobsters are surviving longer potentially due to the reduced fishing pressures.

1.	There is a significant difference in lobster size between 2012 Marine Protected Areas and non-Marine Protected Areas { in line reference values}.
2.	There is a significant difference in lobster size between 2018 Marine Protected Areas and non-Marine Protected Areas {inline reference values}
3.	There is a significant difference between 2012 and 2018 Marine Protected Area sites {inline reference values}.
4.	There is not a significant difference between 2012 and 2018 non-Marine Protected Area sites {inline reference values}

Mean lobster size increased 10.2mm in Marine Protected Areas and decreased 1.3mm in non-protected areas from 2012-2018.  These were statistically significant {inline reference values} and support that Marine Protected Areas reduce potential fishing pressure resulting in higher populations and larger sizes of lobsters.  The population increase in Marine Protected Areas of 1,212 lobsters in comparison to 362 of non-protected areas further supports this finding.

### Summary

* Marine Protected Area lobster populations increased 9 of 12 years collectively resulting in an overall population growth between the two sites of {calculate value}. In comparison, non-protected areas increased 8 of 18 years collectively with a total population increase of {calculate value}
* Bullet from Violins
* After being designated Marine Protection Areas, the Isla Vista and Naples sites increased their mean lobster size 10.2mm while non-protected sites decreased mean size 1.3mm.
