### Introduction

The Marine Managed Areas Improvement Act of 1999 tasked the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to establish a process to designate Marine Protected Areas (MPA) with the goal of protecting sensitive marine ecosystems. On, January 1st, 2012 the coast off of Isla Vista and Naples Point in Santa Barbara County were designated as MPAs (CDFW 2012). Previous studies suggested that marine protected areas are effective at increasing abundance and size of *P.interruptus* (Parnell P. E., et al. 2005), therefore in the interest of quantifying MPA designation impacts in Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTR) began conducting annual counts and size measurements of the California spiny lobster (Reed D. 2019). Using collected data, lobster population and size changes over six years were explored. Abundance of lobsters at each site are explored over time, with qualitative information included regarding the individual MPA site regulations. Size distributions are compared over time for each site with the minimum catch size used as a benchmark for comparison between MPA an non-MPA. Finally, statistical analysis is provided to describe the differences in means between the varying populations.

### Data and Methods

Collection of size and abundance data for *P. interruptus* began in 2012 and is currently ongoing effort conducted by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program. Data available for this report is from 2012 to 2018, and includes samples taken across 5 unique sites, 2 of which (Isla Vista and Naples) are MPAs. For more information on the collection protocols, see the detailed metadata (Reed D. 2019). A time series plot is provided to visually explore lobster counts by location over time (2012-2018) and differences between varying years are used to describe the variation in lobster count changes over time. A violin plot is used to compare the change of size distributions (mm) for each site from 2012 to 2018. A two sample t-test (Welch's t-test, $\alpha = 0.05$ throughout) is used to describe the differences between mean sizes (mm) between MPA and Non-MPA sites from 2012 to 2018. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

```
Change in counts between 2012 and 2018 shows greatest population increases in the Marine Protected Areas.  Isla Vista and Naples increased by `r diff_IVEE["2018","2012"]` and `r diff_NAPL["2018","2012"]` lobsters respectively while Carpinteria, Mohawk, and Arroyo Quemado increased by `r diff_CARP["2018","2012"]`, `r diff_MOHK["2018","2012"]`, `r diff_AQUE["2018","2012"]`. Comparing the differences from 2012 to 2017, Carpinteria has a larger increase (`r diff_CARP["2017","2012"]`) in comparison to both Isla Vista (`r diff_IVEE["2017","2012"]`) and Naples (`r diff_NAPL["2017","2012"]`), however Carpinteria has a substatial drop between 2017 and 2018 (`r diff_CARP["2018","2017"]`) which may be attributed to its unproteced status. 

When looking at abundance changes from year to year, the Marine Protected Areas had population increases every year except 2015 for IV and Naples and 2016 for Naples (9 of 12 increased 75%).  In comparison, the non Marine Protected Areas increased 8 of their combined 18 years(44%). 

When comparing the two MPA sites, Isla Vista and Naples, Naples has significantly lower abundance throughout this time period. This could be attributed to the additional regulatory carveouts for Naples which allow for recreational spearfishing, commercial kelp harvesting, and indigenous Chumas exemption (CDFW, 2012). More research would be required to understand how these carveouts impact the efficacy of MPA designation for preserving lobster abundance.

##### Isla Vista

**Figure 1.1**: Isla Vista was desginated a MPA site in January 1st, 2012. Specific designation is State Marine Conservation Area with the individual MPA regulation allowing ecosystem distrubance in the case of the "operation and maintenance of artificial structures inside the conservation area" (CDFW, 2012). This site has the highest change in lobster abundance from 2012 to 2018 (`r diff_IVEE["2018","2012"]`).

In addition, the Santa Ynez Band of Chumas Indians are "exempt from the area and take regulations found in subsection 632(b)(98) and shall comply with all other existing regulations and statutes" (CDFW, 2012).

#### Results B: Visually explore lobster size distribution shifts by comparing lobster sizes in 2012 and 2018

Comparing lobster sizes at catch sites for 2012 and 2018 shows Marine Protected Area lobsters increasing in size. The peak distribution in size at MPA sites shifted closer to the minimum catch size over this period. Non-protected area lobsters on the other hand, remained relatively unchanged in the distributuion of sizes. This increase in density for larger lobsters in the Marine Protected Area suggests more lobsters are surviving longer potentially due to the reduced fishing pressures.



```{r, fig.align="center", fig.cap="**Figure 2**: Relative distribution of sizes are for each site for 2012 and 2018. The minimum catch size of 82.55mm (Lobster, Spiny. Minimum Size and Verification 2017) is included as a reference point. MPA sites demonstrate a shift from peak distribution far below this reference point to just above, whereas the non-MPA sites show less distributional shift."}

##### Comparison of MPA vs Non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018

The percent difference between the 2012 MPA and Non-MPA lobster size means is `r t_table$percent_difference[1]`, with the non-MPA sites having a larger mean size (`r round(t_table$mean_2[1], digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[3]` compared to `r round(t_table$mean_1[1],digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[1]`). This difference is statistically significant (two-sample t-test, t(`r round(t_table$degrees_freedom[1], 2)`) = `r round(t_table$t_value[1],2)`, p value = `r round(t_table$p_value[1], 4)`), therefore, this finding provides support for the decision to designate these sites with MPA status.

Comparing the sites in 2018, there is a statistically significant difference in lobster size between the MPA and non-MPA sites (two-sample t-test, t(`r round(t_table$degrees_freedom[2], 2)`) = `r round(t_table$t_value[2],2)`, p value = `r formatC(t_table$p_value[2], format = "e", digits = 2)`). The percent difference between these means is `r t_table$percent_difference[2]`, with the MPA sites having a larger mean size (`r round(t_table$mean_1[2], digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[2]` compared to `r round(t_table$mean_2[2],digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[4]`). This difference provides evidence that the high MPA status was effective at increasing the size of lobsters in these areas relative to non-MPA sites. This is compounded considering the size difference found between these site types in 2012.

##### Comparison of 2012 Abundance vs 2018 Abundance in MPA and non-MPA sites

There is a statistically significant difference between 2012 and 2018 MPA sites ( two-sample t-test, t(`r round(t_table$degrees_freedom[3], 2)`) = `r round(t_table$t_value[3],2)`, p value = `r formatC(t_table$p_value[3], format = "e", digits = 2)`). This was seen as a `r t_table$percent_difference[3]` increase in mean size from 2012 to 2018 (`r round(t_table$mean_1[3], digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[1]` compared to `r round(t_table$mean_2[3],digits=1)`mm ±`r final_summary_table$s_dev[2]`). This difference provides evidence that the MPA status was effective at increasing the size of lobsters over time.

At the non-MPA sites the mean size decreased, but the difference was statistically insignificant ( two-sample t-test, t(`r round(t_table$degrees_freedom[4], 2)`) = `r round(t_table$t_value[4],2)`, p value = `r round(t_table$p_value[4], 4)`). It is likely that the overall size had not changed from 2012 to 2018, which provides further evidence that the MPA status was responsible for the increase seen at MPA sites.

### Summary

* Marine Protected Area lobster abundance generally increased over time more than non-MPA sites (Figure 1.1 - 1.5).
* The distribution of lobster size shifted up at MPA sites and remained relatively unchanged at non-MPA sites (Figure 2).
* Lobster mean size was significantly increased over time in areas which were designated as Marine Protected Areas.
